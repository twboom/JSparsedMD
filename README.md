## What is JSparsedMD
JSparsedMD (JSPMD for short) is a Markdown parser written in JavaScript.


## How can I use it

JSPMD can be used in a few different ways:

### Live parsing on website

The original use case JSPMD is developed for is client-side parsing. This has isn't ideal, but if you update your content very often it is quite handy because Markdown is easier to write in. It also isn't needed to build the site the entire time.

### Manual parsing to HTML
JSPMD can also be used to parse Markdown whenever you want! It'll be a website (/desktop app) where you upload your Markdown and it'll be parsed to HTML. This can be useful when content doesn't get updated very often and you can access the HTML very easily. Your workflow will be like this:
* Write content in Mardown
* Upload your content to get it parsed
* Copy and paste the HTML into your website!
